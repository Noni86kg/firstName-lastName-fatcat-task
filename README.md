Explanation of how I have implemented these features:

1. Transfer the project to TypeScript
   I googled "How to add typescript to an existing vite react app?" and some others.

2. Create a List Component
   I was looking at the react-query documentation. I added buttons that change the width of the List component.

3. Create a Form Generator Component
   I was looking at the react-form-hook documentation and some of my old projects where I used react-form-hook and formik. In addition, I watched tutorials on Youtube

4. Create a Page Generator Component
   Improvisation based on the experience of making Architect tools in the current company
